# eCommerce-Data-Analysis
eCommerce Customer Segmentation and Analysis
Overview
This project involves analyzing an eCommerce transactions dataset to segment customers into meaningful groups based on their profiles and purchase behaviors. The goal is to gain actionable business insights, identify customer patterns, and recommend strategies for personalized marketing and improved customer retention.

Project Structure
The project includes the following tasks:

 1) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Perform in-depth EDA to understand customer and transaction data.
Derive business insights from data patterns and trends.
Deliverables:
Python script for EDA.
A report summarizing key business insights.

2)Lookalike Model

Build a model to find customers with similar profiles based on their transaction history and attributes.
Use similarity measures (e.g., cosine similarity) to recommend the top 3 lookalike customers for each customer.
Deliverables:
Lookalike.csv containing customer recommendations and similarity scores.
Python script for the model.

3)Customer Segmentation / Clustering

Apply clustering techniques to segment customers into groups.
Evaluate clustering quality using metrics such as Davies-Bouldin Index and Silhouette Score.
Visualize clusters using PCA for better interpretability.
Deliverables:
Clustering metrics and visualization plots.
A report detailing the segmentation results and business recommendations.
Dataset
The project utilizes the following datasets:

Customers.csv: Contains customer information (ID, name, region, signup date).
Products.csv: Contains product information (ID, name, category, price).
Transactions.csv: Contains transaction details (ID, customer ID, product ID, date, quantity, value).
Note: These datasets are stored locally and can be loaded into the scripts for analysis.

Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
Data Analysis: pandas, numpy
Data Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn
Machine Learning: scikit-learn
Dimensionality Reduction: PCA (from sklearn.decomposition)
